WordPress has a built-in feature that detects when a plugin or theme causes a fatal error on your site, and notifies you with this automated email.
###CAUSE###
First, visit your website (###SITEURL###) and check for any visible issues. Next, visit the page where the error was caught (###PAGEURL###) and check for any visible issues.

###SUPPORT###

If your site appears broken and you can\'t access your dashboard normally, WordPress now has a special "recovery mode". This lets you safely login to your dashboard and investigate further.

###LINK###

To keep your site safe, this link will expire in ###EXPIRES###. Don\'t worry about that, though: a new link will be emailed to you if the error occurs again after it expires.
